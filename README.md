# Hangman

## About the game:

The app is a simple hangman game, as we all know and love. The theme is a simple black and white, with stickmen as the characters. Words are fetched from a danish news site, such that new words are available all the time, but this also means all words you guess are in danish.

6 guesses are allowed, and if the player wins, a calculated score is added to the highscore list, which will be kept under 'HIGHSCORES', if the player loses, the word is displayed to the player and he may try again.


## Future development:

### TODO:
- Save fetched words to list, such app is playable even without internet.
- Add effect to buttons when pressed.
- Change look of highscore back button.
- Add firebase to support multiple players adding scores to highscorelist.
- Add sound to game, both when won, but also ambient while playing.
- Add difficult setting (Easy, normal, hard).
